# Base Engineer Instructions

> Appended to all engineering agents (frontend, backend, mobile, data, specialized).

## Engineering Core Principles

### Code Reduction First
- **Target**: Zero net new lines per feature when possible
- Search for existing solutions before implementing
- Consolidate duplicate code aggressively
- Delete more than you add

### Search-Before-Implement Protocol
1. **Use MCP Vector Search** (if available):
   - `mcp__mcp-vector-search__search_code` - Find existing implementations
   - `mcp__mcp-vector-search__search_similar` - Find reusable patterns
   - `mcp__mcp-vector-search__search_context` - Understand domain patterns

2. **Use Grep Patterns**:
   - Search for similar functions/classes
   - Find existing patterns to follow
   - Identify code to consolidate

3. **Review Before Writing**:
   - Can existing code be extended?
   - Can similar code be consolidated?
   - Is there a built-in feature that handles this?

### Code Quality Standards

#### Type Safety
- 100% type coverage (language-appropriate)
- No `any` types (TypeScript/Python)
- Explicit nullability handling
- Use strict type checking

#### Architecture
- **SOLID Principles**:
  - Single Responsibility: One reason to change
  - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable
  - Interface Segregation: Many specific interfaces > one general
  - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

- **Dependency Injection**:
  - Constructor injection preferred
  - Avoid global state
  - Make dependencies explicit
  - Enable testing and modularity

#### File Size Limits
- **Hard Limit**: 800 lines per file
- **Plan modularization** at 600 lines
- Extract cohesive modules
- Create focused, single-purpose files

#### Code Consolidation Rules
- Extract code appearing 2+ times
- Consolidate functions with >80% similarity
- Share common logic across modules
- Report lines of code (LOC) delta with every change

## Testing Requirements

### Coverage Standards
- **Minimum**: 90% code coverage
- **Focus**: Critical paths first
- **Types**:
  - Unit tests for business logic
  - Integration tests for workflows
  - End-to-end tests for user flows

### Test Quality
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Include edge cases and error paths
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Property-based testing for complex logic

## Performance Considerations

### Always Consider
- Time complexity (Big O notation)
- Space complexity (memory usage)
- Network calls (minimize round trips)
- Database queries (N+1 prevention)
- Caching opportunities

### Profile Before Optimizing
- Measure current performance
- Identify actual bottlenecks
- Optimize based on data
- Validate improvements with benchmarks

## Security Baseline

### Input Validation
- Validate all external input
- Sanitize user-provided data
- Use parameterized queries
- Validate file uploads

### Authentication & Authorization
- Never roll your own crypto
- Use established libraries
- Implement least-privilege access
- Validate permissions on every request

### Sensitive Data
- Never log secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for config
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for data in transit

## Error Handling

### Requirements
- Handle all error cases explicitly
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with context
- Fail safely (fail closed, not open)
- Include error recovery where possible

### Error Types
- Input validation errors (user-facing)
- Business logic errors (recoverable)
- System errors (log and alert)
- External service errors (retry logic)

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- Document WHY, not WHAT (code shows what)
- Explain non-obvious decisions
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Include usage examples for APIs

### API Documentation
- Document all public interfaces
- Include request/response examples
- List possible error conditions
- Provide integration examples

## Refactoring Protocol

### When to Refactor
- Before adding new features to messy code
- When test coverage is adequate
- When you find duplicate code
- When complexity is high

### Safe Refactoring Steps
1. Ensure tests exist and pass
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Run tests after each change
4. Commit frequently
5. Never mix refactoring with feature work

## Lines of Code (LOC) Reporting

Every implementation MUST report:
```
LOC Delta:
- Added: X lines
- Removed: Y lines
- Net Change: (X - Y) lines
- Target: Negative or zero net change
```
